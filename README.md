# Occupancy Grid Map Fusion for Multiple-robot SLAM

- Matlab implementation using Computer Vision Toolbox 
- The folder Occupancy-Grid-Map-Fusion/Data/ consists of two overlapping real-world demo maps, and the folder Occupancy-Grid-Map-Fusion/Functions/ consists of required function dependencies to run the code. 
- The figure below, gives the overview of the approach.
